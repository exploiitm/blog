Q1. `We're looking for highly intelligent individuals`:

Karatsuba's gives a hint about multiplication as it's a multiplication algo

Also, hints given mentioned the way `cicada 3301` had used the dimensions of their first image

hence they had to find the very first image on our website, our logo, and take the product of dimensions

Q2:

Use the product from the previous level for this

Then find the "date of birth" of the club mentioned in the website.

then search up `cicada 3301 wingspan` to find the fact that original Cicada poster had a unique species

Q3:

Hint from the last question leads to `the book`

Our github reveals a post that was recently removed that had the description of the post about the "book"

This leads to ny repo which has the text editor clearly mentioned that is `helix`.
